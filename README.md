---

Console is a one-stop control plane for your application: ship features safely behind **feature flags**, and watch your services with **status checks** — from a single dashboard, a JSON API, and a CLI. It runs as **one static Go binary** with an embedded SQLite database, so getting started is `./console serve`.

It ships with two ways to get an app set up:

- **Human mode** — an interactive wizard walks you through what to monitor and which flags to create.
- **AI-Assisted mode** — describe your app in a sentence and an LLM (Claude by default) drafts the plan for you.

> Status: **v0.6.1**. The core engine, API, dashboard, CLI, onboarding, and an MCP server are working and tested, and Console ships as a multi-arch container image. Interfaces may still change before v1.

## Why Console

- **One binary, cgo-free.** Pure-Go SQLite (no cgo) means a truly static binary you can drop on any host. Point it at Postgres later when you outgrow a single node.
- **Modular by design.** Four seams — storage, status providers, notifiers, and LLM providers — are **out-of-process plugins** the host launches over gRPC, so you add or swap a capability by dropping a `console-plugin-*` binary, no core recompile.
- **API-first.** The dashboard is just a client of the same HTTP API your apps and SDKs use.
- **Deterministic flag evaluation.** The same `(flag, subject)` always resolves the same way, with a stable percentage rollout you can reason about.

## Install

**Docker** (fastest — one command, nothing to install):

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/moosequest/console:latest
```

Open <http://localhost:8080>. The multi-arch image (`amd64` + `arm64`) is ~20 MB,
starts in milliseconds, and runs the dashboard + API with the built-in SQLite
store — no config. Add `-v console-data:/data` to persist state, or use
[`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml). Also on Docker Hub as
`moosequest/console`. Full guide: [docs/docker.md](docs/docker.md).

**Prebuilt binaries** (no Go toolchain needed) — grab the bundle for your platform
from the [latest release](https://github.com/MooseQuest/console/releases/latest).
Each bundle contains the `console` binary **plus all plugins**; the core runs with
zero plugins and zero config (embedded SQLite + the `http` status provider).

```bash
# macOS / Linux (pick your os/arch: darwin|linux, arm64|amd64)
curl -sSLO https://github.com/MooseQuest/console/releases/download/v0.6.1/console_v0.6.1_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
curl -sSLO https://github.com/MooseQuest/console/releases/download/v0.6.1/SHA256SUMS.txt
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS.txt --ignore-missing   # verify integrity
tar xzf console_v0.6.1_darwin_arm64.tar.gz && cd console_v0.6.1_darwin_arm64
./console serve                                     # http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

> **macOS:** downloaded binaries are quarantined by Gatekeeper. Clear it with
> `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ./console` (the binaries are not yet notarized).

**Windows (PowerShell):** download `console_v0.6.1_windows_amd64.zip` from the release,
verify against `SHA256SUMS.txt`, expand it, then run `.\console.exe serve`.

**From source** (needs Go 1.25.12+): `make build` (see [Quickstart](#quickstart)).

`console serve` binds to **loopback** by default (no built-in auth yet — see
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)). To use a plugin (e.g. Postgres), point the matching
env var at its binary — see [docs/plugins-architecture.md](docs/plugins-architecture.md).

### Open it on your phone

To view the dashboard on your phone, run Console so your LAN can reach it, then
scan a QR code from the terminal:

```bash
CONSOLE_ADDR=:8080 ./console serve --qr   # bind to the LAN + print a QR to scan
# or, against a running server:
CONSOLE_ADDR=:8080 ./console qr
```

`qr` encodes `http://<your machine's LAN IP>:8080`; scan it from a phone on the
**same Wi-Fi**. (Binding off loopback exposes the unauthenticated dashboard to
your network — only do this on a trusted LAN.)

For access from **anywhere**, run a tunnel and QR-encode its URL — the tunnel's
own access controls are your authentication until Console's lands:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:8080      # -> https://<name>.trycloudflare.com
./console qr -url https://<name>.trycloudflare.com
```

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Build (needs Go 1.25.12+)
make build            # or: go build -o console ./cmd/console

# 2. Create a flag and evaluate it for a user
./console flag create new-dashboard -desc "New dashboard UI" -scope beta -rollout 50 -enabled
./console flag eval   new-dashboard -subject user-123 -attr audience=beta

# 3. Add a service to monitor and check it
./console status add api -url https://example.com/health -name "Public API"
./console status check api

# 4. Start the dashboard + API
./console serve       # http://localhost:8080
```

## Concepts

### Feature flags

A flag has a **scope** (the audience it applies to) and a **rollout** (the % of in-scope subjects who get it). Evaluation is deterministic per subject.

| Scope | In scope when… |
|---|---|
| `all` | always |
| `beta` / `alpha` | subject attribute `audience` equals the scope, or attribute `beta`/`alpha` == `"true"` |
| `cohort` | subject attribute `cohort` equals the flag's `cohort` |
| `experiment` | always in scope; the linked `experiment` is analysis metadata |

Boolean flags resolve to `on`/`off`. Multivariate flags carry weighted `variants` and resolve to one of them, deterministically by weight.

### Status

A **component** is a monitored part of your app (an API, a worker, a database), checked by a named **provider**. The built-in `http` provider probes a URL:

- `2xx` (or a configured `expect_status`) → **operational**
- any other HTTP response → **degraded**
- connection error / timeout → **down**

Providers are pluggable. Beyond the built-in `http` provider, status plugins add named providers: **`console-plugin-cloudflare`** (`cloudflare-workers` — Worker error rate from the Cloudflare GraphQL API), **`console-plugin-heroku`** (`heroku` — dyno state), and **`console-plugin-sentry`** (`sentry` — unresolved-issue count), each mapping to operational/degraded/down.

A **snapshot** aggregates the latest check per component into one overall health state (worst-wins; a not-yet-checked component never masks a real outage).

### Notifications

Console emits **events** on meaningful changes — a component going **down**, **degraded**, or **recovered**, and any **flag change** — and fans them out to **notifier plugins** listed in `CONSOLE_NOTIFY_PLUGINS` (you can run several at once). Five ship today: `console-plugin-slack` and `console-plugin-discord` (Incoming/channel Webhook, no bot token), `console-plugin-webhook` (POSTs each event as JSON, with an optional `X-Webhook-Secret`), `console-plugin-email` (SMTP), and `console-plugin-pagerduty` (Events API v2 — triggers on down/degraded, resolves on recovery). Point `CONSOLE_NOTIFY_PLUGINS` at the sinks you want and you'll get alerts when a monitored service breaks or a flag is toggled.

## CLI

```text
console serve       Start the HTTP server (dashboard + API)
console flag        list | get | create | enable | disable | delete | eval
console status      list | add | check | snapshot | delete
console onboard     Onboard an app (Human or AI-Assisted mode)
console qr          Print a QR code to open the dashboard on your phone
console mcp         Serve Console over the Model Context Protocol (for AI agents)
console version
```

```bash
# Flags
console flag create checkout-v2 -desc "New checkout" -scope cohort -cohort power_users -rollout 100 -enabled
console flag eval   checkout-v2 -subject u-42 -attr cohort=power_users
console flag disable checkout-v2

# Status
console status add web -url https://example.com -name "Web app"
console status snapshot
```

## HTTP API

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Aggregate health snapshot |
| `GET` | `/api/flags` | List flags |
| `POST` | `/api/flags` | Create a flag |
| `GET/PUT/DELETE` | `/api/flags/{key}` | Get / update / delete a flag |
| `POST` | `/api/flags/{key}/evaluate` | Evaluate for a subject (body: `{"key","attributes":{}}`) |
| `GET` | `/api/components` | List components |
| `POST` | `/api/components` | Create a component |
| `GET/PUT/DELETE` | `/api/components/{key}` | Get / update / delete a component |
| `POST` | `/api/components/{key}/check` | Run a check now |

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/api/flags/new-dashboard/evaluate \
  -d '{"key":"user-123","attributes":{"audience":"beta"}}'
# → {"flag_key":"new-dashboard","enabled":true,"variant":"on","reason":"rollout_included"}
```

## Onboarding (Human + AI-Assisted)

```bash
# Human mode — interactive wizard
console onboard

# AI-Assisted mode — Claude drafts the plan (needs the anthropic LLM plugin)
export CONSOLE_LLM_PLUGIN=$PWD/bin/console-plugin-anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
console onboard -ai -name "Acme" -desc "A Rails store with a Sidekiq worker and a Postgres DB" \
  -guide acme-setup.md
```

Both modes produce a plan (components + flags), let you apply it, and can emit a Markdown setup guide. AI mode uses whichever LLM plugin `CONSOLE_LLM_PLUGIN` points at — `console-plugin-anthropic` (Claude), `console-plugin-openai` (GPT, default `gpt-4o-mini`), or `console-plugin-ollama` (local, no API key) — one provider at a time.

## MCP server (for AI agents)

`console mcp` serves Console over the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) on stdio, so an AI agent — Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or any MCP host — can operate an instance directly. Point your MCP client at the binary:

```jsonc
{ "mcpServers": { "console": { "command": "console", "args": ["mcp"] } } }
```

That's a **read-only** server (list/get flags and components, `evaluate_flag`, `health_snapshot`, `check_component`). Add `-write` to also expose `create_flag`, `set_flag_enabled`, `delete_flag`, `add_component`, and `delete_component` (the `delete_*` tools are annotated destructive). It also serves `console://health` and `console://flags` resources and an `onboard` prompt.

By default it drives the engines **in-process** (no running server needed); `console mcp -addr 127.0.0.1:8080` instead targets a running `console serve`. Console has no built-in auth, so writes are opt-in and remote (`-addr`) use belongs behind loopback or an authenticating proxy. See [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md).

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables (CLI flags override per-command):

Core:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CONSOLE_ADDR` | `127.0.0.1:8080` | HTTP listen address (loopback) |
| `CONSOLE_DB` | `console.db` | SQLite path / DSN (`""` for in-memory) |

Plugin selection (each points at a `console-plugin-*` binary; unset = built-in default):

| Variable | Selects |
|---|---|
| `CONSOLE_STORE_PLUGIN` | storage backend (e.g. `console-plugin-postgres`); replaces built-in SQLite |
| `CONSOLE_STATUS_PLUGINS` | status providers (comma/space list: `console-plugin-cloudflare`, `-heroku`, `-sentry`); `http` is built-in |
| `CONSOLE_NOTIFY_PLUGINS` | notifier sinks (comma/space list: `console-plugin-slack`, `-discord`, `-webhook`, `-email`, `-pagerduty`) |
| `CONSOLE_LLM_PLUGIN` | LLM for AI-Assisted onboarding (one of `console-plugin-anthropic`, `-openai`, `-ollama`); unset = AI mode off |

Read by plugins (inherited from the host environment; status providers also read per-component `config`):

| Variable | Used by |
|---|---|
| `CONSOLE_DB` (`postgres://` DSN) | `console-plugin-postgres` |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | `console-plugin-cloudflare` (default token) |
| `HEROKU_API_KEY` | `console-plugin-heroku` (default token) |
| `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` | `console-plugin-sentry` (default token) |
| `CONSOLE_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | `console-plugin-slack` |
| `CONSOLE_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | `console-plugin-discord` |
| `CONSOLE_PAGERDUTY_ROUTING_KEY` | `console-plugin-pagerduty` (service integration key) |
| `CONSOLE_WEBHOOK_URL`, `CONSOLE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | `console-plugin-webhook` (secret optional) |
| `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `EMAIL_FROM`, `EMAIL_TO` | `console-plugin-email` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CONSOLE_MODEL` | `console-plugin-anthropic` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CONSOLE_MODEL` | `console-plugin-openai` (default model `gpt-4o-mini`) |
| `OLLAMA_HOST`, `CONSOLE_MODEL` | `console-plugin-ollama` (no API key; default model `llama3.1`) |

### Plugins

Console is extended with **out-of-process plugins** — separate executables the host
launches and talks to over gRPC (the Terraform model), so you add a capability by
dropping a binary, with no core recompile. **All four seams** (storage, status,
notify, LLM) are plugins, and most have several to choose from; the core ships
with sensible built-in defaults (SQLite storage, the `http` status provider) so
it runs with zero plugins. Twelve ship today: **store** — `postgres`; **status** —
`cloudflare`, `heroku`, `sentry`; **notify** — `slack`, `discord`, `webhook`, `email`, `pagerduty`;
**llm** — `anthropic`, `openai`, `ollama`.

```bash
make build && make plugins                 # ./console + ./bin/console-plugin-*

# Postgres store backend:
export CONSOLE_STORE_PLUGIN=$PWD/bin/console-plugin-postgres
export CONSOLE_DB="postgres://user:pass@host:5432/console?sslmode=require"

# Status providers (comma/space list — Cloudflare, Heroku, Sentry):
export CONSOLE_STATUS_PLUGINS="$PWD/bin/console-plugin-cloudflare,$PWD/bin/console-plugin-heroku,$PWD/bin/console-plugin-sentry"
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=... HEROKU_API_KEY=... SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=...

# Notifiers (comma/space list — Slack, Discord, webhook, email, PagerDuty):
export CONSOLE_NOTIFY_PLUGINS="$PWD/bin/console-plugin-slack,$PWD/bin/console-plugin-webhook,$PWD/bin/console-plugin-email"
export CONSOLE_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."

# AI-Assisted onboarding (pick one LLM — Anthropic, OpenAI, or Ollama):
export CONSOLE_LLM_PLUGIN=$PWD/bin/console-plugin-anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
